# zv (zig version) manager

`zv` is a blazing-fast, cross-platform, simple-to-use compiler toolchain manager for Zig, written in Rust. `zv` aims to be a fast and dependable manager for Zig and ZLS, both system-wide and project-specific, with either inline syntax `zig +<version>` or by using a `.zigversion` file in your project root. A `version` can be a semver, `master`, or `latest` for the latest stable. These values are fetched from the cached Ziglang download index available at <a href="https://ziglang.org/download/index.json">Zig official index</a>.

With `zv` binaries, you can now build with the master branch without changing your default system Zig version:
```sh
zig +master build
```
Caching is built-in, so you never have to wait any longer than strictly necessary.

You can also specify a version number, e.g., `zig +0.15.1`. With `zv`, you also have the option of pinning per-project Zig versions using a `.zigversion` file, which takes the same format as `+` would for inline Zig commands. You can have a project with these contents:

```py
# file .zigversion
0.15.1
```
which will always use version `0.15.1` when you run any `zig` command inside it. How cool is that?

It also doubles as a project template starter, providing multiple variants of a Zig project, from a barebones template with a very trimmed-down `build.zig` and `main.zig` file, or the standard Zig project template. Find out more with `zv init --help`.

`zv` prefers community mirrors for downloads, as that's the official recommendation, with `minisign` and `shasum` verification done before any toolchain is installed.

## Installation

```sh
# From crates.io
cargo install zv
```

```sh
# From GitHub
cargo install --git --locked https://github.com/weezy20/zv
```

## Usage

All `zv` data lives in `ZV_DIR`, including Zig versions, temporary downloads, cache files, and `zv` itself, which you can set as a custom path.

If not set, the default zv directory is `$HOME/.zv` on Unix-like systems and `$USERPROFILE/.zv` on Windows. `zv` is aware of emulated shells and WSL, so it always picks the correct default location for `ZV_DIR`.

```sh
# Run zv setup as a one-time step to set up directories and environment zv needs.
# If you have ZV_DIR set, it'll prompt you if you wish to make it permanent.

# First, preview changes:
zv setup --dry-run | zv setup -d

# Then, once you're happy, run:
zv setup # This applies those changes and self-installs zv from your current working directory to <ZV_DIR>/bin

# To get help about a particular subcommand:
zv <subcommand> -h (short help) | --help (long help)
# E.g.:
zv setup --help

# To check out zv stats:
zv
```

Once `zv setup` is finished, you can remove the cargo-installed binary if you used cargo: `cargo uninstall zv`.
`zv` will automatically install itself in `ZV_DIR/bin` after making sure that has been included in your `PATH`, so there's no need for a second binary.

Upgrading can be done the same way. You install `zv` from cargo or build it yourself and run `zv setup` to find and replace your existing installation. This is only temporary until `zv upgrade` is implemented, after which this won't be required.

## Use `zv` for project creation:

```sh
zv init [project_name]                 # Create a new Zig project with a name
zv init                                # Create a new Zig project in the current working directory
zv init --zig | -z                     # Create a new Zig project using the standard template provided by `zig init`
```

## Use `zv` as your Zig compiler toolchain manager:

```sh
# Version selection - basic usage
zv use <version | master | stable | latest> # Select a Zig version to use. Can be a semver, master (branch)
zv use 0.13.0                               # Use a specific semantic version
zv use 0.14                                 # Use a version (auto-completes to 0.14.0)
zv use master                               # Use master branch build (queries network to find the latest master build)
zv use stable                               # Use latest stable release (refers to cached index)
zv use latest                               # Use latest stable release (queries network to fetch the latest stable)

# Per-project Zig config
zig +<version> [...zig args]            # Run Zig using a specific <version> (fetches and downloads version if not present locally)
zig +master [...zig args]               # Run Zig using master build. (If already cached, no download, but a network request is made to verify version)
zig [...zig args]                       # Uses current configured Zig or prefers version from `.zigversion` file in the repository adjacent to `build.zig`.

# Management commands
zv list  | ls                          # List installed Zig versions
zv clean | rm                          # Remove Zig versions interactively.
zv clean | rm <version | all>          # Clean up all zv-managed installations using `all` or just a single one (e.g., zv clean 0.14).
zv clean 0.14,0.14.0                   # Clean up multiple Zig installations using a comma-separated list.
zv rm master                           # Clean up the `master` branch toolchain.
zv setup                               # Set up shell environment for zv and display instructions for including `$HOME/.zv/bin` or `<ZV_DIR>/bin` in $PATH
zv sync                                # Resync community mirrors list from [ziglang.org/download/community-mirrors.txt]; also force resync of index to fetch latest nightly builds.
zv help                                # Detailed instructions for zv. Use `--help` for long help or `-h` for short help with a subcommand.
```

`minisign` verification is done using [jedisct1/rust-minisign](https://github.com/jedisct1/rust-minisign) â€” a Minisign library in pure Rust.

It also supports `NO_COLOR` for non-TTY environments.

I hope you enjoy using it! â™¥

### ðŸ”§ Environment Variables for customizing zv

| Variable                  | Description                                                                                                                | Default / Notes                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ZV_LOG`**              | Sets the log level (same as `RUST_LOG`). If set, logging follows the specified level.                                      | Inherits `RUST_LOG` behavior                                                    |
| **`ZV_DIR`**              | Defines the home directory for `zv`.                                                                                       | â€”                                                                               |
| **`ZV_INDEX_TTL_DAYS`**   | Number of days between automatic [index](https://ziglang.org/download/index.json) syncs.                                   | **21 days** â€” Using `master` or `latest` in inline mode use a shorter cache duration of just 1 day unlike `use` which will always fetch `master` & `latest` from network, so practically, you never have to worry about setting this variable yourself. |
| **`ZV_MIRRORS_TTL_DAYS`** | Number of days before refreshing the mirrors list. Broken mirrors degrade automatically. Use `zv sync` to force refresh. | **21 days** â€” mirrors and index can be resynced immediately with `zv sync`. `master` relies on latest builds & so does `latest` and some community mirrors may not have it available; `zv` will retry other mirrors in that case.      |
| **`NO_COLOR`**            | If set, disables color output in all zv commands.                                                                          | No color output; useful for non-TTY environments or scripts.                    |
